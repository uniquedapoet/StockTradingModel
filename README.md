To help you alter your README, here's a general structure that shifts the focus from treating the repository as a module to a showcase of your stock trading model project. This version emphasizes the work you did, the methods used, and the results achieved, instead of positioning it as something that other people can directly use.

### Here's an updated README structure for a project-focused repository:

# Stock Trading Model Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the development of a **stock market trading model** designed to predict stock price movements and generate trading signals based on **S&P 500 stocks**. By leveraging a combination of **technical indicators** and **machine learning algorithms** (primarily LightGBM and XGBoost), the model aims to identify **profitable trading opportunities** while adopting a **conservative trading approach** by limiting trades to one share per day.

The purpose of this repository is to showcase the methodology, data analysis, and results of this stock trading model, rather than serving as a reusable Python module.

## Key Features:
- **Data Source**: The model uses historical stock price data fetched from **Yahoo Finance** via the `yfinance` API.
- **Technical Indicators**: A variety of indicators, such as **moving averages (MA)**, **relative strength index (RSI)**, and **Bollinger Bands**, were employed to understand price trends, momentum, and volatility.
- **Machine Learning**: The model leverages **LightGBM** and **XGBoost** for classification tasks, tuned with **GridSearchCV** and validated with cross-validation.
- **Backtesting**: The model's performance was evaluated using a custom stock market simulation to measure profits over a specified period of time.

## Project Structure:
This repository contains the following key components:
- **Data Collection**: Scripts that retrieve stock market data using the `yfinance` library.
- **Feature Engineering**: Code that generates technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, MACD, Bollinger Bands) used as input features for the machine learning models.
- **Model Training**: Scripts that train the models using **LightGBM** and **XGBoost** classifiers, including hyperparameter tuning.
- **Backtesting Simulation**: A script that simulates the trading process using historical data to evaluate the performance of the trained model.
- **Results**: Visualizations and metrics summarizing the model's profitability.

## Usage
This repository is meant to be a display of the full process behind building a stock trading model. It showcases:
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gathering and preparing historical stock data for analysis.
2. **Model Development**: Training and tuning machine learning models using stock market indicators.
3. **Backtesting**: Simulating stock trading to evaluate the model's performance.

The repository contains detailed Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts to guide you through the process.

## Key Dependencies
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy**: Numerical computing
- **yfinance**: Accessing stock market data
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning tools (including `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning)
- **xgboost**: Gradient boosting machine learning library
- **lightgbm**: Light gradient boosting machine learning library

For a full list of dependencies, please see the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file.

## Visualizations
The results are visualized using various techniques, including:
- **Performance over time**: Showing how the portfolio value changes based on the modelâ€™s trading decisions.
- **Profit & Loss (PnL) Analysis**: Visualizations that show the overall profit percentage over the test period.

## How to Explore the Project
You can explore the project's progress and results by reviewing the notebooks and scripts in the repository:
1. Clone this repository: 
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Navigate to the Stock_Trading_Model_Report notebook and run to view data collection, model training, and backtesting results.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the potential of using machine learning to develop a trading strategy for the stock market. The model showed an average of **22% profit** over a simulated time period, although further improvements could be made with transaction costs, risk management, and additional features.
