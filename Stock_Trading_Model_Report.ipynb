The model is designed to predict stock price movements and generate actionable trading signals, adopting a conservative trading approach by limiting its trades to one share per day.\n","\n","The focus of this model is to maximize profitability while minimizing risk over the long term. Using Yahoo Finance data spanning from 2010 to the present, the model analyzes historical price data, volume, and technical indicators to make informed buy and sell decisions. Tested via a stock market simulation, the model demonstrates an average return of **12% profit** in the past 365 market days.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Data Collection and Feature Engineering\n","\n","I collected historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance and engineered features from technical indicators such as moving averages (MA), relative strength index (RSI), and MACD.

It provides a snapshot of how the model manages cash, stock holdings, and portfolio value, as well as how it responds to market conditions.\n","\n","- **Cash Management**:  \n","  The model holds an average cash balance of **$7,371**, indicating that it seldom invests all available funds in the market at once. This conservative approach ensures liquidity, aligning with the model's restriction of buying or selling only one share at a time, with one exception: if there are five consecutive buy signals, the model purchases five shares. This strategy was tested extensively and was shown to **maximize profits** without negatively impacting potential losses.\n","\n","- **Shares Held**:  \n","  On average, the model holds **25 shares** at any given time. This is a positive outcome, as the goal of the model is to maximize the portfolio's value rather than accumulate cash. By maintaining a balance between investing and preserving liquidity, the model successfully builds the user’s portfolio, as intended, by maintaining an active presence in the market.\n","\n","- **Portfolio Value**:  \n","  The portfolio maintains an average value of **$10,306**, with a typical **3% profit** over the year. This figure indicates that the model **consistently avoids negative returns**, a promising sign for long-term profitability. The portfolio's steady growth, combined with its measured risk approach, suggests that the model is capable of yielding positive returns even under varying market conditions.\n","\n","- The **standard deviation** of the portfolio value (**$955.58**) reflects modest fluctuations, which is expected in a dynamic trading strategy.\n","- The **median portfolio value** of **$10,015.69** shows that, for most of the year, the portfolio hovered slightly above the breakeven point.\n","- The **maximum portfolio value** reached **$16,342**, which shows the potential upside of the strategy, particularly in favorable market conditions.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Final Portfolio Value by Stock"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":62,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["\n","<style>\n","  #altair-viz-0ed0dff92f5840c28b75a56b0588a718.vega-embed {\n","    width: 100%;\n","    display: flex;\n","  }\n","\n","  #altair-viz-0ed0dff92f5840c28b75a56b0588a718.vega-embed details,\n","  #altair-viz-0ed0dff92f5840c28b75a56b0588a718.vega-embed details summary {\n","    position: relative;\n","  }\n","</style>\n","<div id=\"altair-viz-0ed0dff92f5840c28b75a56b0588a718\"></div>\n","<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n","  var VEGA_DEBUG = (typeof VEGA_DEBUG == \"undefined\") ? {} : VEGA_DEBUG;\n","  (function(spec, embedOpt){\n","    let outputDiv = document.currentScript.previousElementSibling;\n","    if (outputDiv.id !== \"altair-viz-0ed0dff92f5840c28b75a56b0588a718\") {\n","      outputDiv = document.getElementById(\"altair-viz-0ed0dff92f5840c28b75a56b0588a718\");\n","    }\n","    const paths = {\n","      \"vega\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega@5?noext\",\n","      \"vega-lib\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-lib?noext\",\n","      \"vega-lite\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-lite@5.20.1?noext\",\n","      \"vega-embed\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vega-embed@6?noext\",\n","    };\n","\n","    function maybeLoadScript(lib, version) {\n","      var key = `${lib.replace(\"-\", \"\")}_version`;\n","      return (VEGA_DEBUG[key] == version) ?\n","        Promise.resolve(paths[lib]) :\n","        new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n","          var s = document.createElement('script');\n","          document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(s);\n","          s.async = true;\n","          s.onload = () => {\n","            VEGA_DEBUG[key] = version;\n","            return resolve(paths[lib]);\n","          };\n","          s.onerror = () => reject(`Error loading script: ${paths[lib]}`);\n","          s.src = paths[lib];\n","        });\n","    }\n","\n","    function showError(err) {\n","      outputDiv.innerHTML = `<div class=\"error\" style=\"color:red;\">${err}</div>`;\n","      throw err;\n","    }\n","\n","    function displayChart(vegaEmbed) {\n","      vegaEmbed(outputDiv, spec, embedOpt)\n","        .catch(err => showError(`Javascript Error: ${err.message}<br>This usually means there's a typo in your chart specification.
