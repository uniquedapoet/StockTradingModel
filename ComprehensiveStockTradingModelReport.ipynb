    "# Comprehensive Stock Trading Model Report\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on the development of a stock market trading model designed to trade **S&P 500** stocks. By leveraging a combination of **technical indicators** and **machine learning algorithms**, the model aims to predict stock price movements and generate actionable trading signals. The primary objective of the model is to identify profitable trading opportunities by analyzing **historical price data**, **volume**, and various other market variables to inform trading decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "One important aspect of this model is that it adopts a **conservative trading approach** by limiting its trades to **one share per day**, ensuring that it is not a high-frequency or high-volume trading model. This approach is focused on maximizing profitability while minimizing risk over the long term.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "- **Technical Indicators**: The model incorporates several well-established technical indicators, such as moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and MACD, which help to identify trends and market conditions.\n",
    "- **Machine Learning**: A machine learning component is employed to predict short-term price movements, using historical data to forecast potential upward or downward trends.\n",
    "- **Risk Management**: Given the modelâ€™s low-volume strategy (one share per day), it is inherently designed to manage risk and avoid the complexities and risks associated with high-frequency trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results:\n",
    "After simulating trades across a few selected **S&P 500** stocks year-to-date, the model has demonstrated an average **12% profit**. While the model is still in the testing phase, these early results indicate its potential to yield sustainable returns over long periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal of the Project:\n",
    "The ultimate goal of this project is to create a robust and scalable model that can trade profitably in the stock market over extended periods. The simulation was conducted using **real historical stock data** from **Yahoo Finance**, which was tested over a one-day trading window. Although the model is in its early stages, the positive returns from the simulation suggest that it can be further refined to deliver consistent performance in live market conditions.\n",
