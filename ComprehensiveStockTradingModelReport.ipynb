    "## Introduction\n",
    "This project is a stock market trading model that trades sp500 stocks, the model uses a combination of technical indicators and machine learning algorithms to predict stock price movements and generate trading signals. The designed is focused on  identifying profitable trading opportunities by analyzing historical price data, volume, and other market variables. **This model trades at most one share a day, this is not a high volume trading model.** After simulating trading a few stocks year to date, the model has shown an average of 12% profit.\n",
