The model is designed to predict stock price movements and generate actionable trading signals, adopting a conservative trading approach by limiting its trades to one share per day.\n","\n","The focus of this model is to maximize profitability while minimizing risk over the long term. Using Yahoo Finance data spanning from 2010 to the present, the model analyzes historical price data, volume, and technical indicators to make informed buy and sell decisions. Tested via a stock market simulation, the model demonstrates an average return of **12% profit** year-to-date (YTD).\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Data Collection and Feature Engineering\n","\n","I collected historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance and engineered features from technical indicators such as moving averages (MA), relative strength index (RSI), and MACD.

Below is a comprehensive list of the 49 features used in the model, grouped by type:\n","\n","### 1. Volume and Moving Averages:\n","- **Volume**: The number of shares traded during a specific period.\n","- **MA_10, MA_20, MA_50, MA_200**: Moving averages over 10, 20, 50, and 200 days, which smooth price data and help identify trends.\n","- **Volume_MA_10, Volume_MA_20, Volume_MA_50**: Moving averages of volume over 10, 20, and 50 days.\n","\n","### 2. Volatility Indicators:\n","- **std_10, std_20, std_50, std_200**: Standard deviations over different periods (10, 20, 50, 200 days), which measure price volatility.\n","- **upper_band_10, lower_band_10, upper_band_20, lower_band_20, upper_band_50, lower_band_50, upper_band_200, lower_band_200**: Bollinger Bands, which define overbought and oversold conditions based on price volatility.\n","\n","### 3. Momentum Indicators:\n","- **ROC (Rate of Change)**: The percentage change in price over a given period, used to measure momentum.\n","- **RSI_10_Day**: The Relative Strength Index over 10 days, a momentum oscillator that identifies overbought and oversold conditions.\n","- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**: Measures the relationship between two moving averages to identify momentum shifts.\n","- **MACD_Hist, Signal**: The histogram and signal line of the MACD, used for generating buy and sell signals.\n","\n","### 4. Candlestick Patterns and Signals:\n","- **Doji**: A candlestick pattern that suggests indecision or a potential reversal.\n","- **Bullish_Engulfing, Bearish_Engulfing**: Candlestick patterns indicating potential bullish or bearish market reversals.\n","\n","### 5. Crossover Signals:\n","- **Golden_Cross_Short, Golden_Cross_Medium, Golden_Cross_Long**: A bullish signal where a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average.\n","- **Death_Cross_Short, Death_Cross_Medium, Death_Cross_Long**: A bearish signal where a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average.\n","\n","### 6. Support, Resistance, and Trend Indicators:\n","- **Resistance_10_Day, Support_10_Day, Resistance_20_Day, Support_20_Day, Resistance_50_Day, Support_50_Day**: Key support and resistance levels over different periods (10, 20, 50 days).\n","- **TR (True Range), ATR (Average True Range)**: Measures of volatility and range in price movements.\n","\n","### 7. Other Indicators:\n","- **OBV (On-Balance Volume)**: Measures the flow of volume in relation to price changes.\n","- **Z-score**: A statistical measure that identifies how far a value is from the mean, used to detect extreme movements or anomalies.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Data Preprocessing\n","\n","The `preprocess_data` function preprocess the data by removing
