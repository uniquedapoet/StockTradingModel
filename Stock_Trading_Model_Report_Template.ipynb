The model is designed to predict stock price movements and generate actionable trading signals, adopting a conservative trading approach by limiting its trades to one share per day.\n","\n","The focus of this model is to maximize profitability while minimizing risk over the long term. Using Yahoo Finance data spanning from 2010 to the present, the model analyzes historical price data, volume, and technical indicators to make informed buy and sell decisions. Tested via a stock market simulation, the model demonstrates an average return of **12% profit** year-to-date (YTD).\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Data Collection and Feature Engineering\n","\n","I collected historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance and engineered features from technical indicators such as moving averages (MA), relative strength index (RSI), and MACD.
