       - **Bollinger Bands** (upper and lower bands).
       - **ATR** (Average True Range) for volatility.
       - **Z-scores** to identify price deviations.
       - **Daily Return** as a target for regression.
       - **Up from Yesterday** as a target for classification (binary: 0 = down, 1 = up).
  3. **Data Splitting**:
     - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets using a time-based split.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Preprocessed dataset with engineered features (including ATR and "Up from Yesterday").
  - Explanation of each feature and its relevance.

#### **Step 4: Model Development**
- **Tasks**:
  1. **Baseline Models**:
     - Implement simple models like ARIMA and Linear Regression for baseline performance on both **Daily Return** (regression) and **Up from Yesterday** (classification).
  2. **Advanced Models**:
     - Develop and fine-tune more complex models like LSTM or GRU for sequential time series modeling.
     - Train models using libraries like `keras`, `tensorflow`, or `pytorch`.
  3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
     - Use GridSearchCV or Random Search to optimize hyperparameters for the advanced models.
  4. **Cross-Validation**:
     - Apply time series cross-validation (e.g., walk-forward validation) to evaluate model robustness.
  5. **Ensemble Methods**:
     - Optionally, implement ensemble models combining predictions from multiple models to improve accuracy.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Trained models for both regression (daily returns) and classification (up/down).
  - Model evaluation report with metrics like RMSE, MAE, and classification accuracy.

#### **Step 5: Model Evaluation and Interpretation**
- **Tasks**:
  1. **Evaluation**:
     - Evaluate models on the test set using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for regression, and accuracy for classification.
     - Plot predicted vs. actual stock prices for regression and confusion matrix for classification.
  2. **Feature Importance**:
     - Analyze feature importance for tree-based models (e.g., XGBoost).
  3. **Backtesting**:
     - Backtest strategies using the classification modelâ€™s trade signals, combined with ATR for setting stop-loss and take-profit levels.
- **Deliverables**:
  - Comprehensive evaluation report with visualizations.
  - Insights on model performance and feature importance.
